        <div class="about-grid">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Sweet Dreams Bakery was born from a simple dream: to bring the warmth and comfort of traditional baking to our community. Founded in 2024, our bakery represents generations of baking knowledge passed down through family traditions.</p>
                <p>Our founders, Maria and Giuseppe, immigrated from Italy with nothing but their grandmother's recipes and an unwavering passion for creating the perfect loaf of bread. What started as weekend baking for friends and neighbors has grown into the beloved neighborhood bakery you see today.</p>
                <p>Every morning at 4 AM, our master bakers begin their work, kneading dough by hand and carefully monitoring each oven to ensure every item meets our exacting standards. This dedication to craftsmanship is what sets us apart in a world of mass-produced alternatives.</p>
